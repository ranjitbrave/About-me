# About-me
## A short introduction about me and my repositories
### I am originally from Bangalore, India. I moved out of India in 2013 to pursue an opportunity from my company in Hamburg for 1 year. That led to a second posting in Miami for 3 years after which I moved back to Hamburg in 2018. My previous role was a Junior Key Account Manager for an Aviation company however, I decided to change career paths as working with data has always been my passion and having an Analytical mind is one of my strengths. In my repositories you will find scrips from two projects I completed as a part of my Data Analytics studies. The first project entailed coding in SQP while the second involved Python. You will find more details regarding the respective projects in each Repository.
